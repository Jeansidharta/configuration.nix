# Vivianite

A Raspberry pi 4B. An old server that I revived after a while.

This was a very old Raspberry I bought years ago. I thought it wasn't working,
so I just stored it away. A few years after, I decided to check it again, and
found out it was still working, and that the previous problem was caused by
myself. Therefore, I decided to name this host Vivianite, as it is a rock
associated with necromancy; bringing the dead to life.
