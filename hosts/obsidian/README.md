# Obsidian

A Desktop PC with a powerful CPU, GPU, and 32GiB of RAM. It's built for modern
videogames, and can be used for compiling software.

I built this PC to be strong and sturdy. It's supposed to be able to handle
anything I throw at it. I therefore named it Obsidian, as it reminds me of
sturdiness and strength.
